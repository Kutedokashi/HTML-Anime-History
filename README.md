# Anime-History

# What is it?
This project has three pages, a mini store, an about me and a homepage where the history of anime is told, its beginnings and how it entered the global industry.

# How does it work?
The page has a navigation list that allows you to move between the other pages and back between them.

# What is it written on?
For this page HTML5 was used thus creating its base structure while CSS3 was also used to style the page.
