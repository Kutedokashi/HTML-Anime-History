            Like manga, anime is a form of entertainment that has been able to break all <br>
            records within audiovisual disciplines. <br> <br>

            It appears for the first time in Japan at the beginning of the 20th century <br>
            as a way of dealing with the giant Disney. These cartoons in the form of Japanese <br>
            cartoons are the representation on the big screen of many of the famous stories <br>
            that we can read in the manga. <br> <br>

            The first anime short film was created in 1917 by the Japanese animator <br>
            Junichi Kouchi. However, we would have to wait for 1960 to begin to enjoy <br>
            the first quality anime and the future influence of world-class productions <br>
            such as Spirited Away or Mazinger Z. <br> <br>

            Both manga and anime can be categorized into a wide variety of genres based <br>
            on particular demographics and subject matter. The fans and faithful followers <br>
            of these cultures are known under the popular term otakus. You can easily <br>
            recognize them in manga parlors for having extensive knowledge of classic <br>
            manga and cosplay.

        <p>
            In the course of the crisis, the <strong> manga and anime </strong> industry became popular in the <br>
            country , thus laying the foundations for the development of its own animated style <br>
            that occurred around the middle of the 20th century; it was around this time that <br>
            Toei Studios emerged, animation film producer, one of the key figures in the history <br>
            of anime; This company was a pioneer in animation in Japan, providing various <br>
            productions that allowed the advancement of animation in the country. The company's <br>
            first animation was <strong> Koneko no rakugaki </strong>, a thirteen-minute short film published in 1957; <br>
            Over the next decade the company grew with a focus on feature film development. Around <br>
            this same period, other companies emerged such as Mushi Pro, a production company that <br>
            made the animation of Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy) by Osamu Tezuka, mangaka and animator, <br>
            one of the most important artists of the Japanese animated industry of the 20th century.

        <h2>
            Why is anime so popular nowadays?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The anime industry has grown considerably in Latin America <br>
            and the United States in recent years. Titles like "My Hero Academia" and <br>
            "Kimetsu no Yaiba" have become huge popular phenomena through social networks, <br>
            with millions of fans waiting for the premiere of their <em> new chapters </em> and <br>
            commenting on the plot in different publications. <br> <br>

            The growth of social networks, the different streaming services, and a <br>
            great accesibility capacity for the different <em> anime productions </em> <br>
            available, has led millions of users to join the fanaticism of Japanese <br>
            animation, a very different panorama from what was seen in the early <br>
            days of the internet, where it was very difficult to find anime episodes <br>
            online.
